# Technology Stack and Architecture

## Technology Stack Selection

### Frontend Framework
After careful consideration, Electron has been selected as the primary framework for developing the Bug Bounty Hunter application. Electron provides several advantages that align with our requirements:

- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Native desktop application capabilities with web technologies
- Rich ecosystem of libraries and tools
- Support for complex UI components and visualizations
- Ability to access system-level features required for proxy interception

For the UI components and reactivity, we will use:
- React.js for component-based UI development
- Redux for state management
- Material-UI and custom components for a modern, professional interface
- Chart.js and D3.js for dashboard visualizations

### Backend Technologies
The application will use a combination of technologies for its backend functionality:

- Node.js as the primary runtime environment
- mitmproxy (integrated via Node.js bindings) for HTTP/HTTPS interception
- SQLite for local data storage with optional cloud sync
- WebSockets for real-time communication between components
- Express.js for internal API endpoints

### Proxy Implementation
For the proxy intercepting functionality, we will leverage:
- mitmproxy as the core proxy engine
- Custom Node.js wrapper for controlling mitmproxy
- Certificate generation and management utilities
- Custom filtering and modification middleware

### Ollama Integration
The Ollama MCP server integration will be implemented using:
- REST API communication with Ollama services
- WebSocket connections for real-time analysis
- Local model caching for offline operation
- Custom prompt engineering for security-focused analysis

### Cross-Platform Strategy
To ensure consistent behavior across platforms:
- Electron's cross-platform capabilities will handle most UI concerns
- Platform-specific code will be isolated in dedicated modules
- Native modules will be compiled for all target platforms
- Installation packages will be created for Windows (MSI), macOS (DMG), and Linux (AppImage, DEB, RPM)

## System Architecture

### Component Architecture
The application will follow a modular architecture with these primary components:

1. **Core Application Layer**
   - Main process for system-level operations
   - Renderer process for UI
   - IPC (Inter-Process Communication) for data exchange

2. **Proxy Interception Module**
   - Proxy server management
   - Request/response interception
   - Traffic filtering and modification
   - SSL/TLS handling

3. **Repeater Module**
   - Request builder and editor
   - Response viewer
   - Comparison engine
   - Template management

4. **Ollama Integration Module**
   - API client for Ollama services
   - Model management
   - Analysis pipeline
   - Result interpretation

5. **Crawler Module**
   - Discovery engine
   - Site mapping
   - Form detection
   - Authentication handling

6. **OWASP Testing Module**
   - Test case management
   - Vulnerability scanners
   - Compliance checkers
   - Rule engine

7. **Reporting and Audit Module**
   - Report generation
   - Evidence collection
   - Export functionality
   - Historical tracking

8. **Data Storage Layer**
   - Local database management
   - Configuration storage
   - Project file handling
   - Backup and recovery

### Data Flow Architecture
The application will implement the following data flow:

1. **Proxy Interception Flow**
   - Browser → Proxy → Target Application → Proxy → Browser
   - Intercepted data → Analysis Pipeline → Dashboard/Storage

2. **Repeater Flow**
   - Request Editor → Target Application → Response Viewer → Analysis

3. **Crawler Flow**
   - Seed URLs → Discovery Engine → Site Map → Testing Modules

4. **Analysis Flow**
   - Intercepted/Generated Data → Ollama MCP → Vulnerability Detection → Reporting

5. **Reporting Flow**
   - Findings Database → Report Generator → Export Engine → User

### Security Architecture
The application will implement several security measures:

1. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypted storage for sensitive information
   - Secure handling of credentials
   - Isolation of project data

2. **Application Security**
   - Code signing for distribution
   - Update verification
   - Protection against local exploitation

3. **Network Security**
   - Proper certificate handling
   - Secure communication channels
   - Option for air-gapped operation

## Development Approach

### Development Environment
- Node.js and npm for package management
- Electron Forge for building and packaging
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- Jest for unit testing
- Spectron for integration testing

### Build and Distribution
- Continuous Integration using GitHub Actions
- Automated builds for all target platforms
- Code signing for production releases
- Auto-update mechanism for seamless updates

### Extensibility Strategy
- Plugin architecture for future extensions
- API documentation for third-party integration
- Scripting support for custom automation

## Technology Justification

The selected technology stack provides several advantages for our specific requirements:

1. **Electron + React**: Enables rapid development of a feature-rich desktop application with modern UI capabilities while maintaining cross-platform compatibility.

2. **mitmproxy**: Provides a robust, well-tested proxy implementation that can handle complex HTTP/HTTPS interception scenarios.

3. **Node.js**: Offers excellent performance for I/O-bound operations like network communication and file handling, which are central to our application.

4. **SQLite**: Provides a lightweight yet powerful database solution that doesn't require separate installation or configuration.

5. **Material-UI**: Delivers a professional, consistent UI experience with built-in accessibility features.

The combination of these technologies will allow us to create a powerful, user-friendly bug bounty hunting application that meets all the specified requirements while maintaining good performance and extensibility.
