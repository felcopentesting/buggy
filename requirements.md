# Bug Bounty Hunter Application Requirements

## Overview
The Bug Bounty Hunter application is designed to be a comprehensive desktop tool for security professionals and bug bounty hunters to test web applications for vulnerabilities according to OWASP standards. The application aims to provide functionality similar to Burp Suite but with improved usability and modern features.

## Core Features

### Dashboard
The application will feature an intuitive, modern dashboard that provides an overview of:
- Active scanning sessions
- Recent vulnerability findings
- Project statistics and metrics
- Quick access to all tools and modules
- Real-time activity logs
- System status indicators

### Proxy Intercepting
The proxy intercepting module will allow users to:
- Capture and inspect HTTP/HTTPS traffic between browser and target applications
- Modify requests and responses on-the-fly
- Filter traffic based on various criteria (domain, content type, status code, etc.)
- Save and load captured traffic for later analysis
- Support WebSocket and HTTP/2 protocols
- Configure proxy settings including port, interface, and SSL options

### Repeater
The repeater functionality will enable users to:
- Manually craft and send HTTP requests to target applications
- Save and organize frequently used requests
- Compare responses from different requests
- Highlight differences between responses
- Support for various content types and encodings
- Template system for quick request generation

### Ollama MCP Server Integration
The application will integrate with Ollama MCP server to:
- Leverage AI for automated vulnerability detection
- Analyze request/response patterns for potential security issues
- Provide intelligent suggestions for exploitation attempts
- Generate human-readable explanations of detected vulnerabilities
- Customize detection rules and sensitivity
- Train on previous findings to improve detection accuracy

### Web Crawler
The web crawler module will:
- Automatically discover and map web application structure
- Identify forms, inputs, and interactive elements
- Support authentication mechanisms
- Respect robots.txt and rate limiting
- Allow for custom crawling rules and depth settings
- Generate site maps and application flow diagrams

### OWASP Testing Framework
The application will implement OWASP testing methodologies including:
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerability checks
- OWASP Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG) procedures
- Custom test case creation and management
- Compliance reporting against OWASP standards
- Regular updates to match latest OWASP guidelines

### Audit and Reporting
The audit and reporting features will include:
- Comprehensive vulnerability reports with severity ratings
- Evidence collection and documentation
- Remediation suggestions
- Export options (PDF, HTML, CSV, JSON)
- Executive summaries and technical details
- Custom report templates
- Historical tracking of findings

### Additional Features
- Project management for organizing multiple targets
- Collaboration features for team-based testing
- Extensibility through plugins or scripting
- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Dark and light theme options
- Customizable keyboard shortcuts
- Regular updates and security patches

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Usability
- Intuitive interface requiring minimal training
- Comprehensive help documentation
- Tooltips and contextual assistance
- Consistent design language throughout the application
- Accessibility considerations

### Performance
- Efficient resource usage
- Fast response times even with large datasets
- Scalable to handle enterprise-level applications
- Background processing for intensive tasks

### Security
- Secure storage of sensitive data
- Protection against local exploitation
- Regular security updates
- Option for air-gapped operation

### Reliability
- Crash recovery mechanisms
- Automatic backups of project data
- Logging for troubleshooting
- Stable operation during extended testing sessions

1. Core proxy and interception functionality
2. Basic dashboard and UI
3. Repeater implementation
4. Ollama MCP integration
5. Crawler and discovery features
6. OWASP testing implementation
7. Reporting and audit capabilities
8. Additional features and refinements
